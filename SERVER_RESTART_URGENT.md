# üö® CRITICAL: SERVER STILL RUNNING OLD CODE!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **PROBLEM:**
Your server is still running the old validation code that causes the duplicate passport ID error. The error message "Some records have duplicate Passport IDs" means the old code is still active.

## üîß **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:**

### **1. RESTART YOUR SERVER NOW:**
```bash
# On your server, run these commands:

# Kill the current server process
sudo kill -9 $(pgrep -f "uvicorn.*main:app")

# Clear Python cache to force reload
cd /var/www/G_ID_engine_production
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +

# Start fresh server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002 --reload
```

### **2. VERIFY THE SERVER IS USING NEW CODE:**
After restart, you should see in the logs:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8002
INFO:     Started reloader process
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### **3. TEST THE FIX:**
- Upload your file again
- Should see **0 skipped records** instead of 8752
- Should see **8753 records processed** instead of 1

## üéØ **WHY THIS IS HAPPENING:**

The error "Some records have duplicate Passport IDs" is coming from **OLD CODE** still running in memory. Your server process is using cached Python files that contain the old validation logic.

**The fix is already in the code, but your server needs to restart to load it!**

## üîç **VERIFICATION:**

After restart, if you still get the same error, it means:
1. Your server is reading from a different code location
2. The updated files weren't uploaded to the server
3. There's a different service/process handling the uploads

## ‚úÖ **EXPECTED SUCCESS MESSAGE:**

After proper restart, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Synchronization Successful!
üìÅ File: Upload_data_20251009_v0.xlsx
üìä Processing Summary:
‚Ä¢ 8753 records processed from file
‚Ä¢ 8753 new records created
‚Ä¢ 0 records skipped
```

**üöÄ RESTART YOUR SERVER NOW - That's the only step needed to fix this issue!**
